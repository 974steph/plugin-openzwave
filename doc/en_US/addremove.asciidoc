== Inclusion / exclusion
When brand new, a module doesn't belong to any Z-Wave network.

=== Inclusion mode

The module needs to join an existing Z-Wave network to be able to communicate with the other modules of that network.
This process is called "inclusion".
Modules can also be removed form a network. This process is called "exclusion".
Those two processes are initiated by the primary controller of the Z-Wave network.

This button allows you to initiate the inclusion mode to add a module to your Z-Wave network.

You can choose the inclusion mode after having clicked on the *Inclusion" button.

Since the introduction of the Z-Wave+ protocol it is possible to secure the information exchange between the controller and the nodes.
It is thus recommended to include modules in "Secure" mode.

If a module does not support the secure mode, you'll have to include it in "Non-secure" mode.

When inclusion mode started, Jeedom lets you know.

When the wizard has launched, you have to set the module in inclusion mode (please refer to its documentation to set it in inclusion mode).

[TIP]
As long as you don't see the ribbon, you are not in inclusion mode.

If you re-click on the button this will exit the inclusion mode.

[TIP]
It is recommended before including a new type of module (recently appeared on the market), to launch the *Config modules" command from the plugin configuration screen.
This action will result in updating the set of openzwave configuration files, as well as the Jeedom command mappinga, with their latest versions.

[IMPORTANT]
During inclusion, it is recommended that the module is positioned less than one meter from the primary controller, 

[TIP]
The *secure* mode inclusion is compulsory for some modules, for instance door locks.

[TIP]
Please note that the mobile interface also allows inclusion (the mobile panel has to be activated).

[TIP]
If a module already belongs to a network, you have to follow the exclusion process before including it, otherwise its inclusion will fail.
It is by the way recommended to initially follow the exclusion process of a module before attempting to include it, even if brand new.

[TIP]
When the included module has been moved to its final location, the network healing command has to be launched, so all the modules will refresh their list of neighbors.


=== Exclusion mode

This button allows you to initiate the exclusion mode to remove a module from your Z-Wave network. You also have to set the module in exclusion mode (please refer to its documentation).

[TIP]
As long as you don't see the ribbon, you are not in exclusion mode.

If you re-click on the button this will exit the exclusion mode.

[TIP]
Please note that the mobile interface also allows exclusion.

[TIP]
A module needs not be excluded by the same controller by which it was previously included. Hence the fact we recommend to do an exclusion before any inclusion.

=== Synchronize

Button allowing to synchronize the modules of the Z-Wave network with the Jeedom equipments. Modules are associated with the primary controller and the corresponding Jeedom equipments are automatically created upon their inclusion. They are also automatically deleted upon exclusion if the option "Automatically delete excluded modules" is activated.

If you included modules independently of Jeedom (requires a battery-powered dongle as the Aeon-labs T-Stick GEN5), a synchronization will be necessary after the dongle is reconnected and the daemon is started and operational.

[TIP]
If you don't see the image or if Jeedom did not recognize your module, this button can fix it (as long as the interview of the module is complete).

[TIP]
If on the routing table and/or the Z-Wave health screen you have one or more modules named after their *generic name*, synchronization should allow to remediate this situation.

The Synchronization button is only visible in expert mode :
