== Configuration of devices

The configuration of the Z-Wave devices is accessible from the plugin menu :

Here below an example of a page of the Z-Wave plugin (presented with some devices) :

image:../images/appliance02.png[]

[TIP]
As in many places in Jeedom, moving the mouse towards the far left opens a quick options menu (you can have it always visible by setting your profile's options).

[TIP]
The upper-line buttons *Synchronize*, *Z-Wave network* and *Health* are visible only if you're in *Expert* mode.

=== General

You can find here the full configuration of your device :

image:../images/appliance04.png[]

* *Name of the devise* : name of your Z-Wave module.
* *Parent object* : indicates the parent object to which the device belongs.
* *Category* : the device categories (the device may belong to more multiple categories).
* *Activate* : sets your device as active.
* *Visible* : visible on the dashboard.
* *Node ID* : ID of the module in the Z-Wave network. This can be useful of for example you want to replace a faulty module : just include the new module, note its ID, and replace the old one with that ID ; finally delete the faulty module.
* *Module* : this field only appears if there exists multiple configuration types for your module (for instance "fil pilote" modules). It allows you to choose the configuration to be used now or later..
* *Brand* : Maker of your Z-Wave module.
* *Configuration* : window for configuration of the parameters of the module.
* *Wizard* : only available for some modules, it assists you configuring them  (Zipato keyboard for instance).
* *Documentation* : this button gives access to the Jeedom documentation related to the module.
* *Delete* : allows deletion of a device as well as its commands without excluding the module from the Z-Wave network.

[IMPORTANT]
Deletion of an device does not exclude its corresponding module from the primary controller.

A deleted device whose module is still attached to its controller will be recreated at the next synchronization.


=== Commands

Here below you can fond the list of commands :

image:../images/appliance05.png[]

[TIP]
According to types and subtypes, given options might not be available.

* the name displayed on the dashboard
* icon : allows, in case of an action, to choose an icon to display instead of its text on the dashboard 
* value of the command : in the case of an action type of command, its value may be linked to an info type of command. For example when for a lamp its intensity is linked to its state, allowing the widget to display the true state of the lamp.
* the type and the subtype.
* the instance of this Z-Wave command (reserved for experts).
* the class of the Z-Wave command (reserved for experts).
* the index of the Z-Wave command (reserved for experts).
* the actual command (reserved for experts).
* "Value of return state" and "Time before return state" : indicates to Jeedom that after a change on the information its value is to be reset to X, after Y minutes. Example : in the case of a motion sensor which only emits when motion is sensed, one can reset its value to 0 after 4 minutes (if no further motion was detected).
* Historization : allows to historize the data.
* Display : allows the display of the data on the dashboard.
* Invert : allows the inversion of the state for binary types.
* Unit : the unit of the data (can be left empty). 
* Min/Max : bounds of the data (can be left empty).
* Avanced configuration (small notched wheel) : allows to display the advanced configuration of the command (historization method, widget...).
* Test : allows to test the command.
* Delete (- sign) : allows to delete the command.


[IMPORTANT]
The *Test* button of a info type command does not directly query the module, but the available value in Jeedom's cache.
The test will only return the current value if the related module transmitted a new value re. the definition of the command. 
It is absolutely normal to not obtain an immediate result when an info type command is created, especially for battery-powered modules that seldom notify Jeedom.

The *magnifying glass*, available the general tab, allows to re-create the set of commands for the current module.

If no commands are available or if there are, but they are erroneous, the magnifying glass can remediate to this situation.


[IMPORTANT]
The *magnifying glass* will delete existing commands. If they were referenced in scenarios or elsewhere, you'll have to correct those references.


=== Command sets

Some modules have multiple pre-configured command sets

image:../images/appliance06.png[]

You can select one in the possible choices, if the module supports it.

[IMPORTANT]
You have to action the magnifying glass to apply the new set of commands.

=== Documentation and Wizard

For some modules, specific assistance to their setup, as well as recommendations on parameters are available.

image:../images/appliance07.png[]

The button *Documentation* gives access to the Jeedom module-specific documentation.

Given modules also have a specific wizard to assist in the application of their parameters and usage. 

The *Wizard* button allows access to the module-specific wizard screen. 


=== Recommended configuration

image:../images/appliance08.png[]

Allows the application of a configuration that is recommended by the Jeedom team.

[TIP]
Upon inclusion, module are driven by their default parameters,  and some functionalities are not activated.

The following elements, depending on the situation, will be applied to simplify the use of the module.

* *Parameters* allowing for the quick setup of all fonctionnalities of the module.
* *Association groups* required for correct usage.
* *Wake-up interval*, for the battery-powered modules.
* Activation of the *manual refresh* for the modules that don't notify their change of states without being requested to do so.

To apply the recommended configuration set, click on the *Recommended configuration" button.
and then confirm the application of the recommended configuration.

image:../images/appliance09.png[]

The wizard activates the different configuration elements.

A confirmation of the correct flow will be displayed as a ribbon.

image:../images/appliance10.png[]

[IMPORTANT]
The battery-powered modules have to be woken-up to apply the configuration elements.

The device page informs you if configuration elements have not yet been applied to the module.
Please either refer to the documentation of the module to manually wake it up, or wait for its next wake-up

[TIP]
It is possible to automatically apply the recommended configurations when including modules, refer to the plugin configuration section for details.
