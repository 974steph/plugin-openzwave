== Backups

The backup area allows you to manage the backups of your network's topology. It is your zwcfgxxx.xml file, containing the latest known state of the network ; it is a kind  of cache. From this screen you can :  

* Start a backup (one is done each time each time the network is restarted and during critical operations). The last 12 backups are kept.
* Restore a backup (by selecting it in the list just above)
* Delete a backup
