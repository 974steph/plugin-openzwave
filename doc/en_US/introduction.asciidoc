== Introduction
Z-Wave communicates using a low-powered radio technology in the frequency band of 868,42 Mhz. It is specifically designed for home automation applications.
Z-Wave is optimized for low-bandwidth exchanges  (from 9 to 40 kbit/s) between battery- or mains-powered appliances.

Z-Wave operates in the sub-gigahertz bandwidth, according to regions (868MHz in Europe, 908 MHz in the US, and other frequencies following the regions' ISM bands). The theoretical range is about 30 meters in-house and 100 meters in the open. Z-Wave networks implement a mesh technology to increase its range and reliability. 
Z-Wave is designed to be easily integrated in low consumption electronic appliances, including battery-powered modules such as remote controls, smoke detectors and security sensors.

Z-Wave+ improves on Z-Wave, for instance in the areas of range and battery life, amongst others. Backwards-compatibility with Z-Wave is guaranteed.

=== Distances to be observed with other sources of wireless signals.
Radio receivers should be placed at at least 50 cm from other radio-electric sources. 

Examples of radio-electric sources :

** Computers
** Micro-waves
** Electric transformers
** radio and video appliances
** Pre-coupling devices for fluorescent lamps

[TIP]
If you use a USB controller (Z-Stick) it is recommended to remove it from the box using a simple extension cable, 1 meter being fine. 


The distance to other wireless transmitters such as phones or audio radio transmitters should be of at least 3 meters.
The following radio sources should be taken in account :

** Disruotions due to electrical motors switches
** Interference by defective electrical appliances
** Disruptions by high-frequency soldering units
** Medical appliances 


== Efficient thickness of walls

Modules should be located in such a way that direct connection lines minimize matter the signal has to go through, such as walls, to avoid significant signal dampening.

Metal frames of the building or furniture can block electromagnetic waves.

=== Mesh and Routing

Z-Wave mains-powered nodes can transmit and repeat messages to nodes that are out of direct range of the controller.
This allows for a greater communication flexibility, even if there is no direct wireless connection, or if a such a connection is temporarily not available, due to a change in the building or room.

The *Id 1* controller can communicate directly with nodes 2, 3 and 4. Node 6 is out of its radio range, however it is in range of node 2. As a result, the controller can communicate with node 6 via node 2. The path from the controller to node 6 via node 2 is called a route.
In case direct communication is blocked between node 1 and node 2, there is another option to communicate with node 6, using node 3 as another repeater.

It becomes obvious that the more mains-powered nodes are in the network, the more routing options and the overall network stability increase.
Z-Wave protocol is capable of routing messages with a maximum of 4 repeating nodes. This is a compromise between the size of the network, its stability and the maximum time to transmit a message.

[TIP]
It is strongly recommended upon initial installation to have a ratio between mains- and battery-powered modules of at least 2/3.
Favor micro-modules over smart-plugs. Micro-modules have a fixed location and will not be unplugged. In general, they also have a better range.
A good start is to lighten common areas. This allows for proper placement of mains-powered modules at strategic locations in your home.
Later, you can add as many battery-powered modules as needed, if your base routes are good.

[TIP]
The "network graph" as well as the "routing table" allow you to visualize the quality of your network.

[TIP]
Repeater modules exist that can be placed in zones where no mains-powered module is useful.


=== Properties of Z-Wave appliances
|===
| |Neighbors |Route |Possible functions

|Controller
|Knows all the neighbors
|Has access to the whole routing table
|Can communicate with any node in the network, if a route exists

|Slave
|Knows all the neighbors
|Has no routing table information
|Can only answer to the node that transmitted the message. Consequently, can not send unsolicited messages

|Routing slave
|Knows all its neighbors
|Has partial routing table information
|Can answer to the node that it received the message and can send unsolicited messages to predefined nodes
|===

In summary :

* All Z-Wave nodes can receive and acknowledge messages
* Controllers can send messages to all nodes of the network, solicited or not ; "the master can talk to anybody, anytime".
* Slaves can not send unsolicited messages, but only a response to requests : "a slave only talks if requested"
* Routing slaves can answer requests and are allowed to send unsolicited messages to given nodes that the controller predefined "the slave stays a slave, but given the authorization, it can talk"
