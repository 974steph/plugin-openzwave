== Update OpenZWave

Following an update of the Z-Wave plugin Jeedom might request you to refresh the Z-Wave dependencies.
A NOK will be displayed at dependencies level.

[TIP]
A refresh of the dependencies is not required at each update of the plugin.

Jeedom should refresh the dependencies itself if it detects they are NOK.
This validation is performed after 5 minutes.


The length of this operation can vary according to your system (up to more than an hour on a raspberry pi).


Upon completion of the dependencies refresh, the daemon will restart automatically at Jeedom validation.
This validation is performed after 5 minutes.


[TIP]
In case the dependencies refresh does not complete itself, please check the *Openzwave_update* log that should contain information about the problem.
